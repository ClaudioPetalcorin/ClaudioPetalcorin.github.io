                Felix De Laet, better known by his moniker Lost Frequencies, has soared to success in the
                        international music industry over the past half-decade. Releasing his global smash hit ‘Are You
                        With
                        Me’ back in 2014 with the track rapidly ascended by hitting multi-platinum status, taking the #1
                        spot in 18 countries and becoming the first Belgian artist to hit #1 in the UK. Proving that he
                        is
                        no one-trick pony in the studio, ‘Reality’ evidenced as another major smash hit from that, and
                        flew
                        to platinum status in no less than 7 territories, before the release of his debut album ‘Less Is
                        More’ (2016), and sophomore follow-up ‘Alive And Feeling Fine’ (2019), showcased his enthusiasm,
                        dedication to craft and sheer skill all whilst playing the long game.

                            As well as this, a zig zag of global dates at the world’s most important festivals including
                            Coachella, Tomorrowland, Lollapalooza, closing down EDC Vegas in spectacular solo style, and
                            a
                            hugely impressive arena run with fellow chart-dominators The Chainsmokers; another year

                            Cyrus’s ‘Malibu’ and LSD Labrinth / Diplo / Sia's 'Thunderclouds', showing that his unique
                            electronic style can lend itself to multi-dimensional pop and still deliver an inimitable
                            sound
                            as
